## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect to Server

1. Verify both devices are connected to Tailscale:
   - Check the Tailscale icon shows "Connected" status
   - Try pinging your server's Tailscale IP from your client device

2. Check if the server is running:
   - Make sure both backend and frontend servers are running
   - Check if you can access the server locally

3. Firewall issues:
   - Ensure your firewall allows Tailscale connections
   - Check if ports 8000 and 3000 are open on your server

### Slow Connection

1. Tailscale performance depends on both devices' internet connections
2. For large file transfers, consider using a wired connection for your server

### Tailscale Disconnects

1. Ensure your server has a stable internet connection
2. On macOS/Windows, check if Tailscale is set to start automatically
3. On Linux, consider setting up Tailscale as a system service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now tailscaled
```
